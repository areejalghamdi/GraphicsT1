Hi Professor Stevens,

- We've created a prototype face and a deformer
  for mouth curvature. 

  smile_blend.ma

- We've linked this with a Qt Gui, which can be 
  run from the PycharmProject directory. It's 
  in the same format as Assignmnet 3.

- We've started on a more sophisticated face shape.
  
  poly_face_v2.ma

- We've been researching ways of dealing with the
  trickier deformations, such as keeping the 
  eyebrows oriented above the eyes, and maintaining 
  pleasant/accurate facial geometry when changing 
  head eccentricity.
